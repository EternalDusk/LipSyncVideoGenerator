<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
<div id="usage"></div>

## Usage

Use transcript tags to add different emotions and poses to your characters.

Simply enclose the pose name relating to the image in angled brackets, then add an underscore to the beginning.

### You must have an image matching the given tag

Example:

```
<_idle> I am recording some test audio

<_proud> to work with my

<_wave> automatic video editor.
```
To run the program with your selected data files:
```
main.py <audio file> <transcript file>
```

Audio files must be in '.wav' or '.mp3' format

Transcript files must be in '.txt' format
